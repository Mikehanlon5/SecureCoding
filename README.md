# SecureCoding
Repository For Security Projects

# To Compile:

First make sure c++ is installed on your computer
Open Visual Studio Code or whatever your preferred IDE
Run the C++ Program
You'll notice another file has been created 'NumericOverflows' (the execution file)
In the terminal navigate to the folder containing this new file
type "./o NumericOverflows' in the bash terminal to execute

# Module 1: Numeric Overflows and Underflows (C++)

In this project, I demonstrate vulnerabilities in c++ code in their various primitive datatypes. 
Finding the limits of each datatype at the upper and lower bound and ensuring they aren't exceeded 
are vital to maintaining robustness and correctness among c++ code, especially at the consumer level.

# Buffer Overflows (C++)

In this file, I demonstrate vulnerabilities in data types and memory storage
Buffer overflows occur when a value too large to be held in its respective variable is exceeded and creates unexpected behavior

# Exceptions (C++)

In the exceptions.cpp file vulnerabilities associated with c++ exceptions are experimented with and how to handle them when they occur so they can be prevented from effecting system performance

# Google Test Suite / Unit Testing

In test.cpp we show a few different unit tests to run on our code. Through the google test suite we can run thousands of different inputs on our functions to make sure we haven't overlooked any potential security risks

# Encryption (C++)

In this zip file we test an implementation of XOR based encryption.
Encryption adds an extra layer of defense against data attacks, as without knowing the key phrase it is nearly impossible to brute force the solution

# Static Code Analysis (C++)

In the static code analysis zip file we contain a file QuestionableCode.cpp and conduct static code analysis upon it. Static Code Analysis allows us to view potential vulnerabilities that may not be immediately obvious at compile or run time.

# Security Policy

A document outlining a security policy to be implemented in a system in the design phase

# Security Policy Presentation

A Presentation describing how the security policy is implemented and why it is valuable
