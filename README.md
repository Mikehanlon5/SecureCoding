# Module 1: Numeric Overflows and Underflows (C++)

In this project, I demonstrate vulnerabilities in c++ code in their various primitive datatypes. 
Finding the limits of each datatype at the upper and lower bound and ensuring they aren't exceeded 
are vital to maintaining robustness and correctness among c++ code, especially at the consumer level.
