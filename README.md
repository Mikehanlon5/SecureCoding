# Module 1: Numeric Overflows and Underflows (C++)

In this project, I demonstrate vulnerabilities in c++ code in their various primitive datatypes. 
Finding the limits of each datatype at the upper and lower bound and ensuring they aren't exceeded 
are vital to maintaining robustness and correctness among c++ code, especially at the consumer level.

To Compile:
First make sure c++ is installed on your computer
Open Visual Studio Code or whatever your preferred IDE
Run the C++ Program
You'll notice another file has been created 'NumericOverflows' (the execution file)
In the terminal navigate to the folder containing this new file
type "./o NumericOverflows' in the bash terminal to execute
